# All variables in Ruby can be of all data types.
# Ruby automatically determines data type by the value assigned to the variable.
# For example:
x = 42 # integer
y = 1.58 # floating point value
z = "Hello" # string

# You can reassign a different value to a variable at any time.
# To insert the value of a variable into a double quote string 
# (a string is a sequence of characters, such as "Hello"), 
# use the # symbol and curly brackets with the variable name.
# For example:
age = 42
print "He is #{age} years old"
# outputs "He is 42 years old"
